# Fluid Numerics' Research Computing Cloud

## What is the RCC
The Research Computing Cloud (RCC) is a cloud-native Research Computing cluster hosted on Google Cloud Platform. The cluster is configured to have a similar look-and-feel to other on-premises resources available at your organization. 

!!! note ""
    <center>**Our goal is to bring you scalable cloud-native computing with top tier support that alleviates additional system administration burdens and promotes productivity for researchers, scientists, and HPC-enthusiasts.**</center>


## Getting Access
Fluid Numerics currently offers two options to get access to the RCC.

1. **Design and deploy under fluidnumerics.com** - With this approach, you do not need to have Google Workspace, Cloud Identity, or a Google Cloud Project. Fluid Numerics will create and manage user accounts, in addition to designing, deploying, and managing your cluster to fit your organization's needs.

2. **Design and deploy in your project** - With this approach, you bring Google Workspace, Cloud Identity, and a Google Cloud Project. We work with you to design, deploy, and manage your cluster.

Both options come with help desk and system administration support services. 


## Pricing
Our pricing model is simple. 

### Compute 
All compute costs are direct billed to you as we receive them from Google Cloud.

### Support Services
Support service rates are billed in units of FTE-Months. An "FTE" is a full-time-employee. You determine how many FTE's you want on-hand to keep your cluster maintained and a warm body behind the help desk (our minimum is 1/8 FTE-month)

FTE-Month | Cost/Month(USD) 
--------- | ----------------
   1/8    |  $4,800.00
   1/4    |  $6,195.00
