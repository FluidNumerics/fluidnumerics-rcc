# Fluid Numerics' Research Computing Cloud

## What is the RCC
The Research Computing Cloud (RCC) is a cloud-hybrid Research Computing cluster hosted on Google Cloud Platform and on bespoke Fluid Numerics' systems. The clusters in the RCC are configured to have a similar look-and-feel to other on-premises resources available at your organization and HPC sites.

    <center>**Our goal is to bring you scalable cloud-native computing with top tier support that alleviates additional system administration burdens and promotes productivity for researchers, scientists, and HPC-enthusiasts.**</center>


## Resources

### Ogopogo
A Google Cloud hosted auto-scaling HPC cluster that provides access to a breadth of resources. This cluster is configurable on-the-fly to meet specific workflow needs. While this cluster is shared across all Fluid Numerics RCC customers, you have dedicated `/home` directories, group directories, and scratch space. See the current list of partitions below in the interactive dashboard.

### Armory
A Fluid Numerics hosted cluster in Hickory, North Carolina. This cluster provides acess to AMD GPUs, including
* Moog - 1x AMD MI25
* Oram - 4x AMD MI50
* Noether - 2x AMD MI210

Hardware on this cluster is meant to support experimentation on bleeding edge hardware and we plan to bring some new oddities to the HPC community in the near future.



## Getting Access
Fluid Numerics provides access to resources through `fluidnumerics.cloud` accounts.

## Pricing
Our pricing model is simple. You pay a flat monthly fee for support services and for the compute resources you use. 

### Compute 
If you deploy in our project, you will need to establish a credit account with Fluid Numerics.

### Support Services
Support services require that Fluid Numerics maintains a staff of experts in high performance computing, cloud computing, and domain sciences. All of these skills are highly valued and necessary to provide top tier support to users of our HPC services. We provide the flexibility of month-to-month contracts with discounted rates on annual contracts.
