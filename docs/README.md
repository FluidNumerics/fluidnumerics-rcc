## What is the RCC
The Research Computing Cloud (RCC) is a cloud-native Research Computing cluster hosted on Google Cloud Platform. The cluster is configured to have a similar look-and-feel to other on-premises resources available at your organization.

Fluid Numerics' RCC is deployed in Google Cloud's `northamerica-northeast1` zone in Montreal, which is a [zero carbon emissions datacenter](https://cloud.google.com/sustainability/region-carbon#data)
