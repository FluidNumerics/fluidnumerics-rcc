# Fluid Numerics' Research Computing Cloud

## What is the RCC
The Research Computing Cloud (RCC) is a cloud-native Research Computing cluster hosted on Google Cloud Platform. The cluster is configured to have a similar look-and-feel to other on-premises resources available at your organization. 

!!! note ""
    <center>**Our goal is to bring you scalable cloud-native computing with top tier support that alleviates additional system administration burdens and promotes productivity for researchers, scientists, and HPC-enthusiasts.**</center>


## Getting Access
Fluid Numerics currently offers two options to get access to the RCC.

1. **Design and deploy under fluidnumerics.com** - With this approach, you do not need to have Google Workspace, Cloud Identity, or a Google Cloud Project. Fluid Numerics will create and manage user accounts, in addition to designing, deploying, and managing your cluster to fit your organization's needs.

2. **Design and deploy in your project** - With this approach, you bring Google Workspace, Cloud Identity, and a Google Cloud Project. We work with you to design, deploy, and manage your cluster.

Both options come with system administration, help desk, and technical support services.

## Pricing
Our pricing model is simple. You pay for the compute resources you use and the human resources you reserve. 

### Compute 
If you deploy in our project, you will need to establish a credit account with Fluid Numerics. All compute costs are direct billed to you as we receive them from Google Cloud.

If you deploy in your project, you pay Google Cloud or your Google Cloud Resell partner directly.

### Support Services
Support service rates are billed in units of FTE-Months and are offered as reservations of our capacity. An "FTE" is a full-time-employee. You determine how many FTE's you want on-hand to keep your cluster maintained and a warm body behind the help desk. If you are unsure of how much support you need, we can help you capacity plan to either supplement your existing staff or leverage us for remote support.
