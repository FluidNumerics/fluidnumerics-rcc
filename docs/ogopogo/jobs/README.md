# Running Jobs

The Research Computing Cloud (RCC) uses the Slurm job scheduler to queue and manage tasks for execution on the cluster.

For scripted tasks, you can use Slurm's [batch capabilities](./batch_jobs.md) to queue thousands of jobs and complete workflows with dependencies. 

Alternatively, interactive sessions provide you direct access to a command line interface on compute nodes that have more resources (e.g. higher core count, more memory, or GPUs) than your typical workstation.

Whether you're considering batch or interactive workflows, it's important to familiarize yourself with typical Slurm commands as well as the available hardware on the RCC.
